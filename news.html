The second lot of 800 racks will be accessible by the end of 2020. This will bring the total number of racks in DataPro data centers to 3,600, allowing the company to occupy second place in the Russian commercial data-center market.</p>

	<p>“Despite all the limitations connected with quarantine, the DataPro team managed to realize this unique project in record time. Work was carried out in close cooperation with Uptime Institute specialists, who confirmed that the project documentation corresponds to integrity level Tier-IV,” said Alexey Soldatov, Director General of Datapro. “It’s true that the pandemic forced changes to our working schedule, delaying Tier-IV certification until after the launch of the data center, but we plan to conclude certification in the Design and Facility categories in the nearest future.”</p>

	<p>“Client inquiry is growing in Russia, and data-center integrity is one of the top requirements for clients. This is an interesting flagship project, which will illustrate the demand for this class of data center in Russia. The success of the project will depend largely on correct pricing policy and promotion of the new premises,” said Stanislav Mirin, a leading consultant at iKS-Consulting.</p>

	<p>“The building of the new data center is the first stage in realizing DataPro’s new strategy, which is aimed at creating Russia’s leading private data-center operator,” said Evgenii Bogdanchikov, deputy director of DataPro. “In the mid-term, the company plans to double the capacity of the first DataPro Moscow 1 premises, and begin building a third data center.”</p></div>

In 2018 DataPro increased the volume of its data center to 2,000 racks, taking the company into the top three Russian commercial data centers, and will continue its development in the nearest future. The high quality and integrity of the facility is confirmed by a full set of certificates corresponding to a standard of Uptime Institute Tier III, including a certificate for Operational Sustainability.</p>

	<p>China Mobile International in Russia is actively working to realise the Chinese government’s Belt and Road Initiative, intended to improve existing, and create new, trade routes and transport and economic corridors connecting Central Asia, Europe and Africa. Among these will be telecommunications and IT infrastructure corridors. <br />
In 2018 China Mobile International officially opened a branch in Russia, setting out three main strategic lines of development: B2O (collaboration with operators), B2B (providing services to corporate clients) and B2C (providing services for mobile users). As part of the development of the corporate sector, China Mobile International intends to give special priority to serving companies that conduct business with the Asian regions, as well as providing cloud services in the Russian Federation.</p>

	<p>“The presence in the Russian market of such companies as China Mobile International enables further development and increased levels of competition, creating the opportunity for clients to receive better and more accessible services,” said deputy director of DataPro Evgenii Bogdanchikov. “The fact that a subsidiary of China Mobile, a company with huge experience and vast expertise in the sphere of data centers, chose our premises once more bears witness to its high levels of integrity and technological effectiveness.”</p>

	<p>China Mobile International, a subsidiary structure of the world’s largest telecommunications operator China Mobile, was established in December 2010. CMI operates in 27 countries. At present it manages over 40 international mainline communications channels, above ground and underwater, with a total carrying capacity of 30 Tb/s, as well as 138 data centres in 91 cities across all continents.</p>

	<p>DataPro is Russia’s leading operator of commercial data-processing centers. The high quality and integrity of the company’s facilities is ensured by the most up-to-date engineering infrastructure. A priority of DataPro is the development of its own network of data centers, and the provision of data-processing-center services and the outsourcing of IT infrastructure to Russian companies on a worldwide basis. DataPro’s Moscow data center is calculated to accommodate 3,000 server racks, making it one of the largest industrial projects in the Russian Federation. Further plans for the company’s development include the building of a second data-processing center in Moscow and St. Petersburg.</p></div>

Experts consider an important market-growth factor to be the rising popularity of the service model for receiving resources and IT services, which will lead companies to stop building their own data centers, and begin to use commercial data centers. This will facilitate significant expense reduction and increased efficiency in receiving and using IT resources and services.</p>

	<p>DataPro Moscow 1, with an area of 16,000m² and convenient transport accessibility on Ulitsa Aviamotornaya, has been operating successfully since 2014. The high quality and integrity of the facility is confirmed by a full set of certificates corresponding to a standard of Uptime Institute Tier III, including a certificate for Operational Sustainability.</p>

	<p>“We are gradually increasing the capacity of our data center according to the occupancy of the existing premises,” said DataPro’s deputy director Evgenii Bogdanchikov. “In 2018 the capacity of the halls provided with all necessary engineering systems and fully ready to accommodate clients’ IT equipment increased to 2,000 racks. This puts us in the top three Russian commercial data centers, which is completely in line with the company’s development strategy.” </p>

	<p>Approximately 95% of new racks are already contracted to clients, so DataPro plans in 2019 to begin realising the next step in the development of DataPro Moscow 1, which proposes to increase capacity by another 1,000 racks, with a subsequent increase to 4,000 racks. Besides which, DataPro is looking for new premises and also considers M&amp;A opportunities, allowing it to further strengthen its position in the Russian commercial-data-center market.</p>
